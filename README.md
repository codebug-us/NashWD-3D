EXAMPLE FUNCTION (Let's do this one together!)
* Write a function called `hotdogNotHotdog` that takes in the name of an item and returns "hotdog" if the item is a hotdog and "not hotdog" if the item is not a hotdog.

* Write a function called `yell` that takes in a string and returns the uppercase version of it. [Hint](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_touppercase.asp) Javascript has a built in function to help you. 
* Write a function called `makeMoreExciting` that takes in a string and returns the string with `!!!` added onto the end of it. 
* Write a function called `getLength` that takes in a string and returns the length of the string. [Hint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/string_length.htm) Javascript has a built in function to help you. 
* Write a function called `rockstarNamer` that takes in the name of your first pet and the name of the street you grew up on. The function should return the string, "Your rockstar name is _____ _____." For example, `rockstarNamer("Snickers", "Cloverdale")` would return, "Your rockstar name is Snickers Cloverdale."
* Write a function called `combinedLength` that takes in two strings and returns the length of the two strings combined. 
* Write a function called `bigDaddy` that takes in 2 numbers and returns the larger number.
* Write a function called `babyDaddy` that takes in 2 numbers and returns the smaller number.
* Write a function called `breakfastChef`. It should take in two booleans. The first is wantsSalty, the second is wantsSweet. The function should look like this `breakfastChef(wantsSalty, wantsSweet)`. If the person wants sweet food it should return chocolate chip pancakes. If the person wants salty food the function should return a ham and cheese omelette. If the person wants sweet and salty, it should return chicken and waffles. If the person does not want sweet or salty it should return water.
* Write a function called `tweener` that takes in two numbers and returns a number that is between the two. [Hint](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/generate-random-whole-numbers-with-javascript/) Javascript has a built in way to generate a random number. We used it in the rock, paper, scissors exercise to get the computerChoice.
* Write a function called `countingInNickels` that takes in a number and returns true or false depending on if the number is evenly divisible by 5 or not. Try googling to find out how JavaScript can help you do this!
* Write a function called `capitalPolice` that takes in a string and returns true if the string contains any capital letters and false if the string does not.

* Write a function called `lastFour` that returns the last 4 characters of a word. Here is a [list of built-in JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp) string functions to help you. If the word is less than 4 characters long it should return "Word is too short!".
* Write a function called `lastNamer`. It should take in one parameter called `fullName` and return just the last name. At first you can just assume all `fullName`s that are entered use the format "Firstname Lastname". Once you've completed that, you can try to handle more complicated inputs such as "Mary Lou Smith". Here is a [list of built-in JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp) string functions to help you.
* Make up your own function exercise to try to stump your classmates!
